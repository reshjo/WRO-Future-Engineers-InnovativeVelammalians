üìñ Project Overview

This project is developed as part of the WRO Future Engineers category, where the challenge is to design and program an autonomous robot vehicle capable of navigating a race track using sensors, cameras, and intelligent control systems.

Our robot is built with a combination of Raspberry Pi (for high-level control) and Arduino Nano (for motor and sensor management). It uses multiple sensors such as ultrasonic, line detection, and IMU to achieve autonomous driving.

‚öôÔ∏è Components Used

Raspberry Pi 3 (main controller)

MicroSD card (OS + programs)

Camera module with wide-angle lens

Arduino Nano with prototyping shield (motor + sensor controller)

DC Motor Controller

DC Motor (driving the vehicle)

Servo Motor (steering)

IMU sensor (motion sensing)

2 √ó Ultrasonic Distance Sensors

2 √ó Analog Line Sensors

Rotary Encoder

External USB Battery with hub (powering Raspberry Pi & Arduino)

Additional motor battery (to power DC motor)

üöó Robot Design

Here is the base chassis we used to build our robot:

üëâ More images of wiring, sensors, and final build will be added soon.

üìù Arduino Nano Code (Motor & Sensor Control)

This Arduino sketch handles low-level motor and sensor control, including:

Reading data from ultrasonic sensors, line sensors, IMU, and rotary encoder

Controlling the DC motor and steering servo

Communicating with the Raspberry Pi for high-level decision making

// === Arduino Nano Motor & Sensor Control ===
// Handles motor driver, servo steering, and sensor inputs

#include <Servo.h>

// Pin definitions
const int motorPWM = 3;         // DC motor PWM pin
const int motorDir = 4;         // Motor direction pin
const int servoPin = 9;         // Servo pin
const int trigPin = 5;          // Ultrasonic Trigger
const int echoPin = 6;          // Ultrasonic Echo
const int lineSensorLeft = A0;  // Line sensor (left)
const int lineSensorRight = A1; // Line sensor (right)

Servo steering;

void setup() {
  pinMode(motorPWM, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(motorDir, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(trigPin, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(echoPin, INPUT);
  pinMode(lineSensorLeft, INPUT);
  pinMode(lineSensorRight, INPUT);

  steering.attach(servoPin);
  Serial.begin(9600);
}

void loop() {
  // Example: read line sensors
  int leftLine = analogRead(lineSensorLeft);
  int rightLine = analogRead(lineSensorRight);

  // Example: basic lane following logic
  if (leftLine < 500 && rightLine < 500) {
    // both sensors see the line
    forward();
  } else if (leftLine < 500) {
    turnRight();
  } else if (rightLine < 500) {
    turnLeft();
  } else {
    stopMotor();
  }
}

// === Motor Functions ===
void forward() {
  digitalWrite(motorDir, HIGH);
  analogWrite(motorPWM, 150); // adjust speed
  steering.write(90); // straight
}

void turnLeft() {
  steering.write(120); // left angle
  analogWrite(motorPWM, 120);
}

void turnRight() {
  steering.write(60); // right angle
  analogWrite(motorPWM, 120);
}

void stopMotor() {
  analogWrite(motorPWM, 0);
}

üíª Raspberry Pi Code (Placeholder)
